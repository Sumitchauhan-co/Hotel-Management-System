# 🏨 Hotel Management System in C++

## 🔍 Description

This is a comprehensive C++ project designed to simulate the core operations of a hotel management system. It is structured using Object-Oriented Programming principles and split across multiple modular components for maintainability and scalability.

The application provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can perform key hotel operations like customer entry, room booking, food ordering, and billing — all backed by file-based persistence using serialization and deserialization.

## 🚀 Features

### 👥 Customer Management
- Add customer details with ID, contact, and name
- Link customers with room numbers
- Search and verify customers

### 🏠 Room Management
- Initialize 50 rooms with varying services (AC, laundry, food, special)
- Book and pre-book rooms based on preferences
- Mark room availability and booking status
- Display room information on demand

### 🍔 Food Ordering
- 50+ food items with default quantity and pricing
- Item-price management via map and vectors
- Order validation with quantity check
- Bill generation based on selected items

### 💳 Billing System
- Calculate room cost with services, GST, and discount
- Auto-generate order bills and final receipts
- Link bill to room and customer
- Maintain bill history in external files

### 💾 Data Persistence
- Use file I/O to serialize customer, room, and bill data
- Load saved data on app launch via `LoadData` class
- Append-mode writing to preserve past entries

## 🧪 How to Compile & Run

```bash
mingw32-make       //This will compile all the .cpp files listed under SRC and produce an executable listed on target
./hotel_app.exe //Command to run the executable
```

To clean up build files:
```bash
mingw32-make clean
```

> Ensure all source files are in the same directory as the Makefile.

## 📂 Data Files Used

- `customer.txt` – Stores customer details
- `room.txt` – Stores room and booking info
- `order.txt` – Stores order item info
- `bill_Manager.txt` – Stores billing records

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- GUI using Qt or SFML
- Switch from flat file to database (SQLite)
- Role-based login for admin/staff
- JSON/CSV export and report generation
- Room availability calendar
